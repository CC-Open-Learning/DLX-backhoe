// HeavyEquipment "English"
// About the document: Listed on this document is the string literals in English of what is used in the HeavyEquipment project.
// In order to construct a string the string needs to be first quoted followed by another string surrounding in quotes for the context.
// Example:
// "ExampleStringToUseInCode"		"Content of string to use in code."
//
// When developing string literals we should be considerate of others therefore some standards are a must.
// As such the document is divided in sections based on their needs.
// The major sections are: General Strings, General Tooltips, General Toasts, and String Groups.
// If there is a particular object that one is looking for using a text editor search feature would be preferred way to find it.
//
// Side Note:
// When developing a sting to use, we have agreed that since the strings are public they should be PascalCase.
// Also, these strings should be formatted by object/group name, type of string, and action/purpose. The action/purpose may be optional depending on object.
// Example of object names:	FrontHood, Coolant, MetalShard
// Example of type of strings:	Title, Description, Toast, Tooltip, Caption, Details
// Example of actions:		Open, Closing, Inspection, Selecting, ClearObject
// Full Examples:		FrontHoodToastOpen, CoolantTitleInspection, MetalShardsTooltip

//General Strings
//About: General strings are used as they are needed but have not too much relation with objects and interfaces in the project but should change
// if other languages were to be used.
//Format: Name Comment, Related Objects to the scene/code base Comment, String Content.

//There are no general strings as of this moment.

//General Tooltips
//About: General Tooltips are used with the SimpleTooltip Component.
//Format: Name Comment, Related Objects to the scene/code base Comment, String Content.
